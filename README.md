This simple calculator allows the user to enter
a string of calculations eg 1+2+3\*4/5

It does not handle a percent key.

The top display shows the equation string.
The next display shows the current term and the answer after the equals key is pressed.

The calculator makes use of the javascript eval function to perform
the calculation to ensure the correct order of operations rules are
applied. eg multiplication and division before addition and subtraction
(brackets buttons are not provided).

A backspace key can be used to delete the last characters of the equation string.

When the answer is calculated after the equals key is pressed, the user can
click another operator button to use the answer as a starting point for
a new equation.

If a digit is clicked after the answer has been displayed,
the calculator is reset.
